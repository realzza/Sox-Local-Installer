# Sox-Local-Installer

## Install from source 
```bash
bash sox-local-installer.sh /sox/absolute/install/dir
```
The whole process takes about half an hour. Be reminded that the `--prefix` argument must be absolute directory, or you will get a error about it.

## Install from conda-forge (recommended)
This is the easiest way to install `Sox` without sudo/root access.
```bash
bash sox-easy-installer.sh
```
